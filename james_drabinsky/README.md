# Ames Housing Prices

*James Drabinsky*

### Problem Statement

Determine which features most influence the sale price of homes in Ames, Iowa and build a model to predict the price of homes in Ames, Iowa.

### Feature Engineering

There was a high correlation between a number of features in the dataset.  This could potentially create an issue multicollinearity.  This included:

- Dropping 'Garage Area' keeping the 'Garage Cars' feature.
- Combining all columns relating to square footage into one column.
- Combining all columns relating to bathrooms into one column.
- Dropping all columns with mostly null values.

### Modeling

I used SKLearn to create and evaluate different regression models based on my final features. 

These models scored as follows:

| Model                   | Train Score | Test Score |
|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Linear Regression       |   0.9409    |   -1.1567  |
| GridSearch w/Lasso      |   0.8785    |    0.8884  |
| GridSearch w/Ridge      |   0.8785    |    0.8884  |


# Summary and Conclusion

Linearity regression does not address the problem of multicollinearity in this dataset. Therefore, I used the Ridge and Lasso regularization techniques to deal with this issue. In Ridge regression the weights for attributes cannot exceed a certain constant. Because of this, Ridge regression models have significantly less error than linear regression. This was proven in my modeling as the Ridge regression had a RMSE of 27885.6367 while the OLS regression had a RMSE of 8.979829382409078e+16. 

Lasso also deals with multicollinearity by zeroing out the less effective variables.  Lasso shrinks the poor performing featureâ€™s coefficient to zero thus, removing some features altogether. This works well for feature selection in cases where there is are a lot of features.  Lasso performed the best out of my three models and its RMSE was a bit lower than the Ridge RMSE.

With the GridSearch w/Lasso model I was able to get an explanation about what features are the most influential to a homes sale price in Ames, Iowa.  The most important features in all of my models were 'overall_quality', 'total_area', 'gr_liv_area', garage area', 'year_remodeled/add' and 'year_built'. This suggests that the most important features in determine housing prices in Ames relate to square footage or the year a home was built/renovated.
