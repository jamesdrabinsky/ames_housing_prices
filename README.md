In this project I was given a dataset of properties in Ames, Iowa which were sold from 2006 to 2010.  My first step was cleaning the data.  This involved filling in cells with null values and making sure that the data frame was correctly formatted (lower case, no spaces).  During EDA I looked to see if I could get rid of any redundant columns.  This involved dropping some columns and also combining multiple features into new columns.  I also plotted out the dataset to see if there were any outliers I needed to drop.  Once the data was clean and my EDA was complete I starting modeling.  I set up a pipeline and assigned the parameters.  Then I set up three models (linear, lasso, ridge) and assessed the R2 and RMSE score that each model produced.  The lasso model performed the best so I submitted it to kaggle, along with the other models I prepared.
